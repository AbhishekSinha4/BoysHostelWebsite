# BoysHostelWebsite
### 3rd Semester Web Development project
This project is a sample website for my colleges' boys hostel.

It makes use of the following technologies:
* HTML (HTML5) 
* CSS (CSS3)
* JavaScript
* PHP
* MySQL

It supports 2 types of users. The staff and the students.
Staff can only be added by the warden and other staff members with the "permission" to do so.  
Students can register and sign up to join the hostel.  
The warden credentials for login are:  
  staff id: warden1  
  password: iamwarden  
  
Students can review the hostel.  
Staff can make announcements.  

To run the project, apart from downloading the project, the sql file must be uploaded to a server and then referenced instead of the references made in the current project. Server used for the purposes of this project was xampp and database was on phpMyAdmin.

The current code uses the command mysqli_connect to connect to the database. Replace arguments with appropriate hostname, username and password to connect to the database instead of the current username and password.
